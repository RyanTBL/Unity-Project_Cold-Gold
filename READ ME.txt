This project was undertaken as a university assignment for the 3D games development module.

The video itself involves an unnamed player who  has to sneak around various levels avoiding hostile mobs that patrol around, the idea being to collect as much 'loot' as possible before making their way to the exit, there are sneaking, looting, platforming and key hunting elements.

Uploaded to the portfolio is a trailer for the game created showcasing some of the levels and gameplay, as well as some of the raw script files taken out of Unity for display, also included is a link to DropBox where an executable version of the game can be downloaded.
